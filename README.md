## Issues and Lessons
 
A short description about the issues that you faced and the lessons that you learned.
 
- Wasn't really associated with this "app" per say, but learned more about the XML file and how to manipulate the different fields of LinearLayout and RelativeLayout
- How to add an image to the project, the ImageView component, and the Drawable folder
- Learned about good styling/positioning habits
- Learned how ordering of the elements in the XML affects the layouts
